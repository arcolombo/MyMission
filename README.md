# MyMission
This is a personal statement of my mission regarding enlisting in the path for solving cancer.  My cousin was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma cancer at the age of 13, and we lost him at the age of 18.  Our family was very close, and we often refer to it as a loss of a brother.  These experiences shaped my desire to become much more involved in cancer research.  Cheryl Mattingly in her text "The Paradox of Hope" describes very accurately how I felt in her anthropological study on families enduring cancer treatment.  Essentially, it is not uncommon for families who lose kin to cancer to become activists in some manner because their desperate hope for their children's recovery transforms into a broader hope such that they desire recovery for all ill children.  Many families become involved with fund-raising, etc.  In my situation, after deciding to become involved with science, it does bring me closure to strive for building hope for other struggling families.
